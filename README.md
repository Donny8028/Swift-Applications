Swift Applications
===================
## Introduce
In these projects, I applied openData or open resource API to it, all of these would make these Apps more vivid and enjoyable.

I started to following these, and made these projects. Plus other subjects of Swift, I'v spent nearly six months from a total beginner. And when you believe "Practice make perfect." thing, then nothing would ever defeat you. Hoping people like me as a beginner will make a good step to do these things seem impossible.
